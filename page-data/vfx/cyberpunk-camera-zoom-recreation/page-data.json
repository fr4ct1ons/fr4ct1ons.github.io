The pixelation effect that plays when you zoom the camera in and out seemed like a nice option, so I decided to reproduce that in Unreal.</p>\n<iframe class=\"ytEmbedVideo\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfQGzpYpUKo?si=4zY6doht2dikp9Tf\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-hgrdZ8YjE\">This is how the original effect looks like.</a></p>\n<p>The screen coordinates are pixelated using the usual multiply-floor-divide method. Then, the distance of the UVs to the center of the screen is used as a mask to switch between the pixelated view and the full-res view. While studying the original effect, I noticed that the resolution gets higher progressively, so I used the same distance mask to interpolate between lower and higher resolution pixelations.</p>\n<p>One part of the effect that I did face trouble making was the blue outline. In Cyberpunk, there's a blue outline that appears on the edges of objects. From what I've seen, the original uses a depth-based algorithm. Unfortunately, none of the edge detection algorithms I tried could properly replicate the original effect. I plan to return to this effect later and update it with proper edge detection.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 13, 2024","slug":"/vfx/cyberpunk-camera-zoom-recreation","title":"Cyberpunk 2077 camera zoom (recreation)"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dc5ccfb6-6b0b-57ac-a6c0-69295d3b647f","frontmatter__slug":"/vfx/cyberpunk-camera-zoom-recreation","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"vfx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2007905456"],"slicesMap":{}}
