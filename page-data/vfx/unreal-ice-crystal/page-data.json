Some of the other textures used on this effect are available freely on internet and were not made by me.</p>\n<p>I've used Niagara for spawning and controlling every object seen on the effect, such as smokes, sparkles and the crystal itself. The crystal object uses a custom shader, that reads from a texture of cracks and a gradient map to simulate the crystal slowly cracking after some time. Both the shader and textures were made by me.</p>\n<p>While this effect was made with turn-based combat in mind, it can still work in cases of realtime combat with minor adjustments, such as to properly show the area of effect that attack might have.</p>\n<iframe class=\"ytEmbedVideo\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qf1qbCeU8nc?si=_XAGghOVsnh7bW1Y\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 06, 2023","slug":"/vfx/unreal-ice-crystal","title":"Unreal exploding ice crystal"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0e893000-f9c4-5aa4-a874-33329596418a","frontmatter__slug":"/vfx/unreal-ice-crystal","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"vfx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2007905456"],"slicesMap":{}}
