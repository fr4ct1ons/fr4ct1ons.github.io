The liquid is rendered with sphere tracing, with multiple sphere SDFs.</p>\n<p>Each sphere's normal is calculated and rendered with Unreal's lighting. Each sphere (and its normal) is smoothly joined with one another, simulating the floating blobs inside the lamp's liquid.</p>\n<p>For the spheretracing, I had to use a custom expression node inside Unreal's material editor. This was also my greatest challenge when creating this, as not only it was very limited in how it works, it's not really a robust solution. All of this made me wish that Unreal had an better way to either create custom nodes or even a proper HLSL shader editor, like other engines.</p>\n<iframe class=\"ytEmbedVideo\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QU-eefK1kg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 26, 2022","slug":"/vfx/unreal-sdf-lava-lamp","title":"Raymarching lava lamp - Unreal"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6b156870-4cd8-5fc3-a5c5-790337029e26","frontmatter__slug":"/vfx/unreal-sdf-lava-lamp","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"vfx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2007905456"],"slicesMap":{}}
